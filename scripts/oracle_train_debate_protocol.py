🔮 Oracle Training Script: Inter-Agent Debate Protocol

Oracle trains all Justice League heroes on how to participate in
inter-agent debates using sequential thinking and the narrator system.

Training Objectives:
1. All heroes learn debate methods (debate_position, question_hero, etc.)
2. Heroes understand when and how to question orders
3. Heroes practice sequential thinking in debates (3-7 steps)
4. Oracle asks mission-critical questions that reframe debates
5. Superman makes informed decisions based on team input

Training Methodology:
- Add debate methodology to Oracle's knowledge base
- Generate practice scenarios for all heroes
- Demonstrate debate flow with examples
- Test hero understanding with mock debates
