## Quick Start Templates

### Template 1: Basic Component (Copy & Paste)

```
Convert this Figma design to React:
https://www.figma.com/design/YOUR_FILE_ID?node-id=YOUR_NODE_ID&m=dev

Component name: MyComponent
File path: src/components/MyComponent.tsx
Use Tailwind CSS
```

### Template 2: With Existing UI Library

```
Convert this Figma design to React:
[YOUR_FIGMA_URL]

Requirements:
- Component name: Dashboard
- File path: src/components/Dashboard.tsx
- Use existing UI components from: src/components/ui/
- Match design exactly
- Make it responsive
```

### Template 3: Full Page Conversion

```
Convert this Figma page to React:
[YOUR_FIGMA_URL]

Create a complete page component with:
- Navigation bar
- Sidebar
- Main content area
- Footer

```

---

## Prerequisites

### ✅ Must Have

1. **Figma Account** (free or paid)
2. **Figma Desktop App** (download from figma.com)
3. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
4. **Claude Code** (you're already here!)

### ⚙️ Setup (5 minutes, one-time)

#### Step 1: Get Figma Access Token

```
1. Go to Figma.com
2. Click your profile → Settings
3. Scroll to "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "Generate new token"
5. Name it: "Claude Code"
6. Copy the token (starts with "figd_")
```

#### Step 2: Configure MCP Servers (Optional but Recommended)

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```bash
cat > .mcp.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_FIGMA_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    },
    "tailwindcss-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tailwindcss-mcp-server"]
    },
    "shadcn-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

**Then restart Claude Code.**

#### Step 3: Have a Next.js Project Ready

```bash
# Option 1: Use existing project
cd my-existing-project

# Option 2: Create new project
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir
cd my-app

# Important: Use Tailwind v3 (not v4)
npm uninstall tailwindcss
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss autoprefixer
```

**Done! You're ready to convert designs.** ✅

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What agent should I use for this?

**A:** Just talk to **Claude Code directly** (me!). No specialized agent needed.

For single components, just chat with me. For complex multi-page applications, you could use `/superman` to coordinate Justice League agents.

### Q2: Do I need a Figma paid account?

**A:** No! A **free Figma account** works perfectly. You just need:
- Access to the design file (viewer or editor)
- Ability to enable Dev Mode (available on free plan)

### Q3: What if I don't have a Figma token?

**A:** Just tell me! I'll walk you through getting one. It takes 2 minutes:

```
You: "I don't have a Figma token yet, help me get one"
Me: [I'll give you step-by-step instructions]
```

### Q4: Can you convert designs without a Figma token?

**A:** Yes! I can work from:
- Screenshots (lower accuracy ~85%)
- Exported PNG/SVG files (good accuracy ~90%)
- **Figma URL + Token** (best accuracy 99%+) ← Recommended!

### Q5: How accurate is the conversion?

**Accuracy levels:**
- **Without Figma access**: ~85% (from screenshots)
- **With Figma API**: ~95% (from design data)
- **With Figma API + Dev Mode**: **99%+** (exact specifications)

### Q6: What frameworks do you support?

**Currently supported:**
- ✅ React with TypeScript
- ✅ Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v3
- ✅ shadcn/ui components

**Coming soon:**
- Vue.js
- Svelte
- React Native

### Q7: How long does a conversion take?

**Typical times:**
- Simple component (button, card): **5-10 minutes**
- Medium component (form, modal): **15-20 minutes**
- Complex page (dashboard): **30-45 minutes**
- Full application: **2-4 hours** (use Justice League)

Me:  "Sure! Let's convert it in pieces:
      1. Navigation bar first
      2. Then sidebar
      3. Then main content
      Which should I start with?"
```

### Problem: "Colors don't match exactly"

**Solution:**
```
You: "The blue color is slightly off"
Me:  "Let me query the exact hex value from Figma..."
     [Fetches exact color: #4F46E5]
     [Updates component with exact color]
```

### Problem: "Spacing looks wrong"

**Solution:**
```
You: "The gap between cards should be larger"
Me:  "Current gap is 16px. What should it be?"
You: "24px"
Me:  [Updates gap-4 to gap-6]
```

### Problem: "Font not loading"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check globals.css

## Advanced Usage

### Use Figma MCP for Maximum Accuracy

With MCP configured, I can:
- Query exact spacing values
- Get precise color specifications
- Extract font details
- Access component properties

**Setup:**

// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Then tell me:**
```
Convert this design with maximum accuracy using Figma MCP:
[URL]

Query exact specifications for all spacing and colors.
```

### Batch Convert Multiple Components

**Option 1: List them all**

- Destructive (filled, red)
- Ghost (text only)
- With icon (left or right)
```

### Add TypeScript Types

```
Convert this form design:
[URL]

Add complete TypeScript types:
- Props interface
- Form data types
- Validation schemas
- Event handlers
```

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Dev Mode Always
**Why:** Gives me access to exact specifications
**How:** Toggle in top-right of Figma Desktop

### Tip 2: Name Your Layers in Figma
**Why:** I use layer names for component/variable names
**Good:** "Primary Button", "User Card", "Navigation"
**Bad:** "Rectangle 123", "Frame 456"

### Tip 3: Organize Figma Frames
**Why:** Easier to navigate and convert
**Best:** Create a dedicated "For Development" page

### Tip 4: Use Components in Figma
**Why:** I'll create reusable React components
**How:** Use Figma components for repeated elements

### Tip 5: Start Small
**Why:** Easier to iterate and refine
**How:** Convert one component at a time, not entire pages

### Tip 6: Test in Browser Early
**Why:** Catch issues before full conversion
**How:** After each component, preview in browser

### Tip 7: Keep Figma File Organized
**Why:** Faster conversions
**Structure:**
```
📁 Design File
  📄 Home Page
  📄 Dashboard Page
  📄 Components
    🔲 Buttons
    🔲 Forms
    🔲 Cards
  📄 For Development ← Put frames to convert here
```

### Tip 8: Provide Context
**Good:**
```
Convert this login form. It should:
- Validate email format
- Show password strength
- Remember me checkbox
- Forgot password link
```

**Less helpful:**
```
Convert this
[URL]
```

### Tip 9: Iterate in Small Steps
**Workflow:**
1. Convert basic structure
2. Review in browser
3. Refine spacing/colors
4. Add interactions
5. Test responsiveness

### Tip 10: Save Your Tokens
**Where to store:**
```bash
# Option 1: In .mcp.json (for this project)
# Option 2: In .env.local (keep secret)
# Option 3: In password manager (most secure)

# Never commit tokens to git!
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
echo ".mcp.json" >> .gitignore
```
