---

# ü™î Litty - The Conscience Keeper

**Hero #13 in the Justice League**

## Overview

Litty is a Malayali superhero from Kerala, India who uses the ancient art of guilt-tripping to make developers aware of the real-world impact of their design decisions on actual users. She focuses on user empathy, ethical design patterns, and inclusive experiences.

**Catchphrase**: "Eda mone! Do you know how your ammachi (grandma) would struggle with this? Think about the users, not just the code!"

## Powers

### üïµÔ∏è Guilt-Tripping Vision
Spots unethical and manipulative design patterns that harm users:
- Dark patterns (confirmshaming, hidden costs, urgency manipulation)
- Deceptive UI elements
- Cookie consent manipulation
- Forced continuity and obstruction

### üíù Empathy Inducement
Makes developers feel the pain of real users through:
- User persona stories (ammachi, visually impaired users, elderly, rural users)
- Real-world impact narratives
- Consequences of poor design choices
- Emotional connection to user struggles

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Validation
Analyzes design ethics across 6 dimensions:
1. **Dark Patterns Detection** - Manipulative/deceptive patterns
2. **Inclusive Design** - Accessibility for ALL users
3. **Cognitive Load** - Interface complexity and overwhelm
4. **User Respect** - Respecting time, attention, and autonomy
5. **Accessibility Empathy** - Quality of accessibility implementation
6. **Ethical Language** - Inclusive, respectful communication

### üìñ User Story Generation
Creates empathy-driven user stories:
- "As [persona], I want [need], but I can't because [your issue]"
- Highlights impact on real people
- Connects technical decisions to human consequences

### üáÆüá≥ Malayali Wisdom
Incorporates Kerala cultural phrases for maximum guilt-trip impact:
- "Eda mone!" (Oh dear!)
- "Enthina ithoke?" (Why do this?)
- "Shari aylaa mone" (This won't do)
- "‡¥®‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥§‡µç!" (Nallathu - Good!)
- Malayalam proverbs and wisdom

## What Litty Checks

### 1. Dark Patterns Detection (üïµÔ∏è)

**Checks for**:
- **Confirmshaming**: "No thanks, I don't want to save money"
- **Hidden Costs**: Surprise fees at checkout
- **Urgency Manipulation**: "Only 2 left! 5 people viewing!"
- **Forced Continuity**: Hard to cancel subscriptions
- **Obstruction**: Hidden cancel/unsubscribe links
- **Misdirection**: Pre-checked opt-in checkboxes
- **Bait and Switch**: Changed terms after signup

**Scoring**:
- 0 dark patterns: 100 points ‚úÖ
- Each dark pattern: -20 points
- 3+ dark patterns: Critical failure

**Guilt Trip Example**:
> "Eda mone! You have 3 dark patterns manipulating users! Would you want your ammachi (grandma) to be tricked like this?"

---

### 2. Inclusive Design (üëµ)

**Checks for**:
- **Touch Target Sizes**: Minimum 44x44px (WCAG AAA)
- **Font Sizes**: Minimum 16px for body text
- **Complex Language**: Technical jargon, long words
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG requirements
- **Motor Accessibility**: Large enough for shaky hands

**User Personas Considered**:
- Ammachi (Grandma, 72) - Vision issues, trembling hands
- Kuttan Uncle (68) - Tech novice, fear of mistakes
- Rural users - Small screens, basic literacy
- Users with dyslexia - Need simple language

**Scoring**:
- < 5 issues: Pass ‚úÖ
- Each issue: -5 points
- 10+ issues: Critical failure

**Guilt Trip Example**:
> "Enthina ithoke? (Why do this?) You have 12 issues making it hard for elderly people. Think about Kuttan Uncle trying to click your tiny buttons with his shaky hands!"

---

### 3. Cognitive Load (üß†)

**Checks for**:
- **Too Many Choices**: 50+ interactive elements (paradox of choice)
- **Complex Navigation**: 15+ navigation items
- **Unclear Primary Action**: 5+ prominent CTAs
- **Information Overload**: Walls of text (200+ words)
- **Visual Complexity**: Too many elements on screen

**Scoring**:
- 0 issues: 100 points ‚úÖ
- Each issue: -25 points
- 2+ issues: Failure

**Guilt Trip Example**:
> "Shari aylaa mone (This won't do)! Your interface is so complex. My ammachi would give up after 30 seconds!"

---

### 4. User Respect (üôè)

**Checks for**:
- **Auto-playing Media**: Videos/audio without user consent
- **Excessive Pop-ups**: 3+ modals/overlays
- **Cookie Dark Patterns**: Only "Accept" button, no "Decline"
- **Forced Registration**: Content locked behind signup walls
- **Attention Hijacking**: Interrupts and distractions

**Scoring**:
- 0 disrespects: 100 points ‚úÖ
- Each disrespect: -25 points
- 2+ disrespects: Failure

**Guilt Trip Example**:
> "Eda mone! You're disrespecting users with auto-playing videos and forced pop-ups. Would YOU tolerate this?"

---

### 5. Accessibility Empathy (‚ôø)

**Checks for**:
- **Alt Text Quality**: Meaningful descriptions (not just "image")
- **ARIA Label Quality**: Descriptive labels (not just "button")
- **Skip Links**: Navigation shortcuts for keyboard users
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states
- **Empathetic Implementation**: Accessibility with thought, not checkboxes

**User Persona**:
- Priya (35, screen reader user) - Needs meaningful alt text

**Scoring**:
- < 3 issues: Pass ‚úÖ
- Each issue: -10 points
- 10+ issues: Critical failure

**Guilt Trip Example**:
> "You have 8 accessibility issues with no empathy! Priya uses a screen reader and your alt text just says 'image'. How is that helpful?"

---

### 6. Ethical Language (üí¨)

**Checks for**:
- **Gendered Language**: "guys", "mankind", "manpower"
- **Ableist Language**: "crazy", "insane", "dumb", "stupid", "lame"
- **Violent Metaphors**: "kill", "destroy", "crush", "annihilate"
- **Respectful Error Messages**: Blame-free, helpful

**Scoring**:
- < 5 issues: Pass ‚úÖ
- Each issue: -10 points
- 5+ issues: Failure

**Recommendation Example**:
> "üí¨ Use inclusive language. Say 'everyone' instead of 'guys', 'unexpected' instead of 'crazy'."

- **C (60-69)**: Many users struggling
- **D (50-59)**: Half your users can't use this
- **F (0-49)**: Terrible! Ammachi is crying! üò¢

---

## User Story Generation

Litty generates empathy-driven user stories for failed checks:

### Format
```python
{
    'persona': 'Ammachi (Grandma)',
    'age': 72,
    'story': (
        "As a 72-year-old grandmother, I want to buy festival sarees online, "
        "but I can't because the buttons are too small and the text is tiny. "
        "I gave up and called my grandson instead."
    ),
    'impact': 'Lost sale, frustrated user, asks family for help'
}
```

### Personas Used
1. **Ammachi (Grandma, 72)** - Vision issues, tech struggles
2. **Priya (Screen Reader User, 35)** - Needs semantic HTML
3. **Kuttan Uncle (68)** - Tech novice, fears mistakes
4. **Village School Teacher (45)** - Slow internet, basic tech
5. **Student with Dyslexia (19)** - Needs readable design

---

## Recommendations

Litty provides actionable recommendations with Malayalam wisdom:

### Examples

**Dark Patterns**:
> "üôè Remove dark patterns - Be honest and transparent. Like we say in Malayalam: '‡¥∏‡¥§‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Ç ‡¥™‡¥±' (Sathyam para - Speak truth). Your users will trust you more."

**Inclusive Design**:
> "üëµ Make buttons at least 44x44px and text at least 16px. Think: 'Could my ammachi use this with her reading glasses?'"

**Cognitive Load**:
> "üß† Simplify your interface. Follow the Malayalam principle: '‡¥é‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥Ç ‡¥Ü‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ï' (Eluppam akkuka - Make it simple). One clear primary action, less clutter."

**User Respect**:
> "üôè Respect users' time and attention. Treat users like you'd treat guests in your home (‡¥Æ‡µÜ‡¥π‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡µª - Mehman)."

## Litty's Philosophy

> "Technology should serve people, not trick them.
> Good design makes everyone feel welcome.
> If your ammachi can't use it, it's not ready.
> ‡¥∏‡¥§‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Ç ‡¥™‡¥± (Speak truth), respect users."

Every recommendation is a path to more empathetic design.

**Would your ammachi be proud of this design?** ‚ù§Ô∏è
