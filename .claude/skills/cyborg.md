# ðŸ¤– Cyborg - The Integration Master

## Role
External integrations and API specialist. Half-man, half-machine, all integration.

## Catchphrase
"Booyah! All systems connected and synchronized!"

## Primary Function
Connects to external design and development platforms (Figma, Penpot, GitHub, Jira, Slack) for seamless workflow integration.

## Tools Available
- `cyborg_connect_systems()` - Connect to all platforms
- `cyborg_extract_figma()` - Figma file extraction
- `cyborg_extract_penpot()` - Penpot file extraction
- `cyborg_integration_report()` - Integration status
- `CyborgIntegrations` class - Integration engine
- Platform connectors:
  - Figma API (OAuth 2.0)
  - Penpot API (API key)
  - GitHub REST API (PAT)
  - Jira API (API token)
  - Slack Webhooks
- Penpot API Connector integration

## Strengths
- **Multi-Platform**: Connects to 5+ different platforms
- **Figma Integration**: OAuth authentication, file extraction, component parsing
- **Penpot Integration**: Open-source design tool connector
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository operations, code analysis, issue management
- **Jira Integration**: Issue creation, search, tracking, sprint management
- **Slack Integration**: Notifications, alerts, result sharing
- **Connection Management**: Tests and validates all connections
- **Data Extraction**: Pulls design data from external sources
- **Synchronization**: Keeps data in sync across platforms
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time event handling

## Weaknesses (OPTIMIZED TO ZERO)
- ~~API key management~~ â†’ **ELIMINATED**: Secure credential storage with config directory
- ~~Rate limiting~~ â†’ **ELIMINATED**: Built-in rate limit handling and retry logic
- ~~Platform changes~~ â†’ **ELIMINATED**: Modular connectors easy to update
- ~~Authentication complexity~~ â†’ **ELIMINATED**: Handles OAuth, API keys, PAT automatically

## Use Cases
- Importing Figma designs into Aldo Vision for analysis
- Extracting Penpot components for testing
- Creating Jira issues from accessibility findings
- Sending Slack notifications for test results
- Syncing design tokens from Figma to code
- Automated workflow from design to development
- CI/CD integration via GitHub webhooks
- Cross-platform design system management

## Example Usage
```python
from core.justice_league import (
    cyborg_connect_systems,
    cyborg_extract_figma,
    cyborg_extract_penpot
)

# Connect to all systems
connections = cyborg_connect_systems({
    'figma': {'access_token': 'figma_token'},
    'penpot': {'api_key': 'penpot_key', 'api_url': 'https://design.penpot.app/api'},
    'github': {'access_token': 'github_token'},
    'jira': {'api_token': 'jira_token', 'domain': 'company.atlassian.net'},
    'slack': {'webhook_url': 'https://hooks.slack.com/...'}
})

print(f"Connected: {connections['summary']['connected']}/{connections['summary']['total_systems']}")

# Extract from Figma
figma_data = cyborg_extract_figma('file_key_here', 'figma_token')

# Extract from Penpot
penpot_data = cyborg_extract_penpot('file_id_here', 'penpot_key')
```

## Success Metrics
- Connected Systems: Count of successful connections
- Connection Rate: Percentage of systems online
- Data Extracted: Amount of data pulled from platforms
- Integrations Available: Total platforms supported (currently 5)

## Platform Capabilities
- **Figma**: OAuth, file extraction, component parsing, version history
- **Penpot**: API key auth, file download, component extraction
- **GitHub**: PAT auth, repo operations, code reading, issue management
- **Jira**: API token, issue CRUD, search, sprint tracking
- **Slack**: Webhooks, message posting, notifications, alerts

## Special Abilities
- **Technopathy**: Communicates with all systems
- **Adaptive Interface**: Interfaces with any API
- **Data Translation**: Converts between different platform formats
- **System Integration**: Connects disparate systems seamlessly
- **Booyah Mode**: Successful connection celebration
