#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Oracle Status - $(date) ==="

# System health
HEALTH=$(curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=oracle_system_health | jq -r '.data.result[0].value[1]')
echo "System Health: ${HEALTH}%"

# Error rate
ERRORS=$(curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(oracle_errors_total[5m]) | jq -r '.data.result[0].value[1]')
echo "Error Rate: ${ERRORS}/sec"

# Response time (p95)
P95=$(curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=histogram_quantile(0.95,rate(oracle_operation_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) | jq -r '.data.result[0].value[1]')
echo "Response Time (p95): ${P95}s"

# Active alerts
ALERTS=$(curl -s http://localhost:9093/api/v1/alerts | jq '[.data[] | select(.status.state=="active")] | length')
echo "Active Alerts: ${ALERTS}"

echo ""
EOF

chmod +x monitor.sh

# Run every 3 minutes
watch -n 180 ./monitor.sh
```

### Success Criteria (T+15)

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| System Health | >90% | ☐ |
| Error Rate | <1% | ☐ |
| Response Time (p95) | <500ms | ☐ |
| Active Critical Alerts | 0 | ☐ |
| All Agents Status | Healthy | ☐ |

**Checkpoint at T+15**: All criteria met?
- ✅ YES → Continue to extended monitoring
- ❌ NO → Assess severity, consider rollback

---

## Phase 4: Extended Monitoring (T+15 to T+60)

### T+15 to T+30: Performance Validation

**Secondary Operator:**

```bash
echo "Running performance validation..."

# Run performance benchmarks
python3 performance/benchmark_suite.py

# Expected: 8/8 passing, similar to pre-deployment
```

**Record Results:**
```bash
echo "=== T+30 Performance Results ===" >> launch-log.txt
cat performance/reports/benchmark_*.json | tail -1 >> launch-log.txt
```

---

### T+30 to T+45: Load Testing (Optional)

**If production traffic is low, simulate load:**

```bash
echo "Running load test..."

# Simple load test (adjust concurrency as needed)
seq 1 100 | xargs -P 10 -I {} curl -s http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null

# Monitor during load
./monitor.sh
```

---

### T+45 to T+60: Final Verification

**Primary Operator:**

```bash
echo "Running final verification..."

# 1. Run full health check
python3 deployment/health_check.py
# Expected: 0 (healthy)

# 2. Check all agents
python3 -c "
from core.oracle_integration.superman_connector import get_superman_interface
summary = get_superman_interface().get_agent_health_summary()
print(f\"Health: {summary['overall_health']:.1f}%\")
assert summary['overall_health'] >= 90, 'Health below 90%'
print('✅ All agents healthy')
"

# 3. Check for any warnings in logs
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml logs oracle-blue | grep -i "error\|warning" | tail -20

# 4. Verify backup system
ls -lh oracle_backup_*.db | head -5

echo "✅ Final verification complete"
```

---

### T+60: Go-Live Decision

**Launch Commander:**

**Final Go-Live Criteria:**

| Criteria | Target | Actual | Pass |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Uptime | 100% | _____% | ☐ |
| System Health | >90% | _____% | ☐ |
| Error Rate | <1% | _____% | ☐ |
| Response Time | <500ms | _____ms | ☐ |
| Active Alerts | 0 | _____ | ☐ |
| Agent Health | All healthy | _____/11 | ☐ |

**Decision:**
```bash
if [ "ALL_CRITERIA_MET" = true ]; then
    echo "🎉 PRODUCTION LAUNCH SUCCESSFUL"
    # Send success notification
    # Remove green container (optional)
    # Update status page
else
    echo "⚠️ ISSUES DETECTED - ASSESS FOR ROLLBACK"
    # Evaluate severity
    # Decide: continue monitoring or rollback
fi
```

---

## Phase 5: Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### When to Rollback

**Automatic Rollback** (Immediate):
- Error rate > 50%
- All agents down
- Data corruption detected
- Service completely unresponsive

**Manual Rollback** (Within 15 min):
- Error rate > 10%
- System health < 50%
- Multiple agents unhealthy
- Unresolved P1 incident
- Performance degradation > 50%

---

### Execute Rollback

**Launch Commander:** "EXECUTE ROLLBACK"

**Primary Operator:**

```bash
echo "⚠️ EXECUTING ROLLBACK - $(date)" | tee -a launch-log.txt

# Method 1: Automated rollback
./deployment/deploy.sh production --rollback --force

# Method 2: Manual rollback (if automated fails)
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml exec nginx nginx -t
# Update nginx to point to green
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml exec nginx nginx -s reload

# Verify rollback
python3 deployment/health_check.py

# Monitor for 15 minutes
./monitor.sh
```

**Rollback Verification:**
- [ ] Traffic switched to green (previous version)
- [ ] Health check passing
- [ ] Error rate normalized
- [ ] System stable

**Post-Rollback:**
1. Create incident ticket
2. Preserve logs for analysis
3. Root cause analysis
4. Fix and retest
5. Schedule new launch date
