**A**: They can retake after reviewing the missed topics. The exam is open-book and focused on practical knowledge.

### Q: Do we need commercial SSL certificates?
**A**: No. Let's Encrypt (free) is recommended and fully automated. Commercial certificates are optional.

### Q: Can we launch with only 1 certified operator?
**A**: Not recommended. Minimum 2 operators required for coverage and backup.

### Q: What happens if we need to rollback?
**A**: Blue-green deployment enables rollback in < 5 minutes. Process is fully documented and tested.

### Q: How much does the monitoring cost?
**A**: Zero. All monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager) are open-source and included.

### Q: Do we need to modify any code?
**A**: No. All code is complete and tested. Only configuration needed (SSL, alerts).
