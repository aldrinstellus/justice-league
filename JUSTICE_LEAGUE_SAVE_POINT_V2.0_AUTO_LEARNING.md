# 🔮 Justice League v2.0 - Oracle Auto-Learning System

**Save Point Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Foundation Complete (38% - Phases 1 & 2)
**Next**: Phase 3 - Superman Integration

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Oracle has been transformed from a **passive knowledge base** into a **proactive, self-improving learning engine** that automatically learns from every Justice League operation.

### Problem Solved

**Before**: Oracle only learned when Superman manually called `track_mission_outcome()` after full missions. Individual hero operations weren't tracked, user satisfaction wasn't inferred, and there was no automatic improvement system.

**After**: Oracle now automatically captures every hero operation, infers user satisfaction from context, generates insights and recommendations, and makes the entire Justice League smarter with each mission.

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Components (COMPLETE)

#### 1.1 Learning Session Manager
**File**: `core/justice_league/oracle_meta_agent.py` (lines 2228-2364)

Created `LearningSession` class that tracks:
- User request (original words)
- User intent (parsed)
- Mission type
- All hero operations (start/end times, results)
- User satisfaction (inferred)
- Learnings and recommendations
- Errors, retries, follow-up questions

**Key Methods**:
- `log_operation_start(hero, operation, context)` - Tracks operation beginning
- `log_operation_complete(hero, operation, result)` - Tracks operation end
- `to_dict()` - Converts to JSON for storage

#### 1.2 Satisfaction Analyzer
**File**: `core/justice_league/satisfaction_analyzer.py` (NEW - 350 lines)

Analyzes 7 context signals to infer user satisfaction:
1. ✅ Mission success/failure
2. 📊 Accuracy scores (90%+ = happy, <70% = unhappy)
3. ❌ Error frequency
4. ⏱️ Completion time
5. 🔄 Retry attempts
6. 💬 Follow-up question sentiment
7. 📈 Operation success rate

**Returns**:
- Satisfaction score (0-1)
- Confidence level (0-1)
- Assessment (happy/neutral/unhappy)
- Evidence signals

**Smart Questioning**: Only asks user for feedback when confidence < 60%

#### 1.3 Data Schema Update
**File**: `data/oracle_project_patterns.json` (lines 774-806)

Added three new sections:
```json
{
  "learning_sessions": {},
  "satisfaction_patterns": {
    "user_satisfaction_history": [],
    "satisfaction_thresholds": {
      "accuracy_threshold_happy": 90,
      "accuracy_threshold_acceptable": 75,
      "learned_from_samples": 0
    }
  },
  "hero_insights": {
    "artemis": {...},
    "green_arrow": {...},
    "hawkman": {...}
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Core Integration (COMPLETE)

#### 2.1 HeroBase Learning Hooks
**File**: `core/justice_league/hero_base.py` (lines 71, 109-110, 803-892)

Enhanced all heroes with:
- `oracle` attribute for auto-learning connection
- `learning_session` attribute set by Superman
- `_start_operation(operation_name, context)` hook
- `_complete_operation(operation_name, result)` hook

**How it works**:
```python
def some_hero_method(self, param1, param2):
    # Start hook - logs to learning session
    self._start_operation('some_hero_method', {
        'param1': param1,
        'param2': param2
    })

    try:
        # ... hero logic ...
        result = {'success': True, 'score': 95}

        # Complete hook - triggers Oracle learning
        self._complete_operation('some_hero_method', result)
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        # Error hook
        error_result = {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}
        self._complete_operation('some_hero_method', error_result)
        raise
```

#### 2.2 Oracle Learning Methods
**File**: `core/justice_league/oracle_meta_agent.py` (lines 1551-1815)

Added 6 new methods to OracleMeta class:

1. **`start_learning_session(user_request, user_intent, mission_type)`**
   - Creates LearningSession
   - Returns session object
   - Called by Superman at mission start

2. **`complete_learning_session(session, results)`**
   - Analyzes satisfaction
   - Generates insights
   - Creates recommendations
   - Stores session
   - Returns advisory for presentation

3. **`learn_from_operation(hero, operation, result, session)`**
   - Auto-invoked by hero hooks
   - Real-time learning from every operation
   - Logs high-performance and failure patterns

4. **`_generate_session_insights(session)`**
   - Extracts learnings from completed session
   - Identifies hero strengths and weaknesses
   - Correlates with user satisfaction

5. **`_generate_session_recommendations(session)`**
   - Actionable suggestions for improvement
   - Threshold adjustments
   - Methodology reviews

6. **`_store_learning_session(session)`**
   - Persists session to oracle_project_patterns.json
   - Updates satisfaction history
   - Keeps last 50 sessions

## 💡 Usage Example (After Phase 3)

```python
from core.justice_league import SupermanCoordinator

# Create Superman with Oracle
superman = SupermanCoordinator()

# Deploy team (Oracle learns automatically)
results = superman.assemble_justice_league({
    'url': 'https://example.com',
    'user_request': 'Analyze this website',  # NEW
    'user_intent': 'website_analysis',       # NEW
    'options': {...}
})

# Oracle automatically:
# 1. Created learning session
# 2. Tracked all hero operations
# 3. Inferred user satisfaction
# 4. Generated insights
# 5. Presented recommendations

# Advisory shown via narrator:
# 🔮 Oracle: "Mission complete! Here's what I learned:
#   ✅ Batman tested 15 interactive elements successfully
#   ✅ Wonder Woman found WCAG compliance at 98%
#   💡 Consider caching Batman's test results for faster re-runs
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Implementation

### 1. Session-Based Learning Works
- Tracking entire user interaction gives full context
- Duration, errors, retries all matter for satisfaction

### 2. Inference > Interruption
- 7 signals provide 75%+ confidence
- User prefers non-intrusive learning
- Only ask when confidence < 60%

### 3. Hooks Are Non-Intrusive
- Heroes just wrap methods with start/complete
- No changes to core logic needed
- Failures in learning don't break heroes

### 4. Standard Pattern Scales
- HeroBase provides infrastructure
- Apply once, works for all 18 heroes
- Consistent behavior across team
