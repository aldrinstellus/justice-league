## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test pass rate gave high confidence
2. **Documentation-First**: Documentation throughout development, not at end
3. **Iterative Development**: Weekly milestones kept project on track
4. **Performance Focus**: Early optimization led to exceptional results
5. **Real-World Validation**: Scenario testing caught issues before production

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Earlier Security Scanning**: Could have run security scans earlier in development
2. **Load Testing**: Should have done more comprehensive load testing
3. **Database Migration**: SQLite→PostgreSQL migration path could be clearer
4. **Operator Training**: Could start operator training earlier in process
5. **Monitoring Alerts**: Could tune alert thresholds earlier

### Recommendations for Future Projects

1. **Start with CI/CD**: Set up pipeline in Week 1
2. **Security from Day 1**: Run security scans from start
3. **Documentation Continuously**: Write docs as code is written
4. **Test Real Scenarios Early**: Don't wait until Weeks 9-10
5. **Train Operators Sooner**: Start training in parallel with development
6. **Performance Baselines**: Establish targets and test early
7. **Monitoring from Start**: Set up basic monitoring early
